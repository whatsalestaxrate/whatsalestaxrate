# whatsalestaxrate

Keeping up with sales tax sucks. Tools like Avalara/Avatax are amazing at dealing with all the complexities, but many small businesses either can't afford or can't implement all the software. Sometimes you just need to know what rate to charge and move on. This utilizes Avalara's public API and Mapbox to let users see the sales tax rate for a given location. 

No assurances are made on the rates shown, check with your tax professional and/or local taxing authority for specific guidance.
